### [Coordinates]
The bottom left of the screen, where the axis markers are located is X(0) Y(0) Z(0). \
The coordinate ranges are:/
    X: 0 -> 280/
    Y: -30 -> 160/
    Z: 0 -> 370/

### [Placing Blocks]
* Use the following command in chat to place a block.
* Replace X, Y, and Z with the coordinates you want to use.
* Replace BLOCKID:BLOCKID with the block id you want to use.\
(You can find the block id's in the blocks file in this repository, or at https://minecraft-ids.grahamedgecombe.com/ or similar sites.)\
\
NOTE: some blocks in the lists might not work.

Command: 
```
setblock X Y Z BLOCKID:BLOCKID
```

Example (Place a grass block at X(100) Y(50) Z(100)):
```
setblock 100 50 100 2:0
```
